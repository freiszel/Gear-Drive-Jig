# Gear-Drive-Jig
Simple mounting  jig to make hobbed gear-driver for FDM extruders

I was wondering if it was possible to make a stainless steel hobbed gear drive using a M3 turning tap. Some technique
described in RepRap are based on pressing taps mounted in drilling machines against bolts, using bearings mounted in a vise to
let the bolt spin. This method works reasonably well for soft iron bolts, but when I tried to replicate the method in hard
stainless steel rods, the only result I got were lots of broken taps.

In this page I describe a simple mounting jig that was used successfully to make MK8 stainless steel hobbed drive gears.
Besides the jig, the technique requires a lathe and a milling machine to make precision machined gears.
